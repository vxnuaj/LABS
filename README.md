### This GIT Repo is my Training Grounds.

**Goal:** Increase technical skillsets as a means of training myself to contribute to the future of humanity at the [bleeding edge of technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) and the [beginning of infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity)


As I build and ship projects, there are specific engineering skillsets which I'll be working on.


The code I write whilst I'm gaining these skillsets will be written in this GIT repo.


I'll be adding as I go :)
