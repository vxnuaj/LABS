### This is my Training Grounds.

The action plan is to increase technical skillsets as a means of training myself to contribute to the future of humanity at the [bleeding edge of technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) and the [beginning of infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity).


The code I write and learnings I takeaway whilst I'm gaining these skillsets will be written in this git repo.


I'll be adding as I go :)
