# Mat Mul AB and CR

- $A$ times column $j$ of $B$ produces column $j$ of $AB$

- $AB$ is usually different from $BA$ but $(AB)C = A(BC)$ always holds.

- If we have a matrix $A$ of dimensions $(m, n)$ and a matrix $B$ of dimensions $(n, p)$, the matmul of $AB$ will yield a $C$ of dimensions $(m, p)$

- Matmul is non commutative, $AB â‰  BA$
  
- For matmul, the associative law still holds as $(AB)C = A(BC)$ as well as the distributive law as $A(B+C) = AB + AC$

- For a Rank-1 matrix, $A = CR$ where $C$ is the first column of $A$ and $R$ is the first row of $A$.
