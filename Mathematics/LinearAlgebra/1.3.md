# 1.3 Matrices and Their Column Spaces

In a matrix-vector multiplication, say:

$A \cdot x$ 

where

$A = \begin{pmatrix} 1, 3 \\ 2, 4 \end{pmatrix}$

$x = \begin{pmatrix} 3, 2 \end{pmatrix}$

the multiplication is essentially the dot product of each row of $A$ with each component in $x$.

If $A$ is an $n$x$m$ matrix and $x$ is an $1$x$m$ vector, the number of operations will be $n$x$m$, in this example then being a total of 4 multiplications. 

Note that each row in $A$ must have the equivalent number of components within $x$. Otherwise, the multiplication is impossible.

**Rank**

The $Rank()$ of a matrix is defined as the number of linearly independent rows or columns in a matrix, say $A$.

The row $Rank(A)$ and column $Rank(A)$ are equivalent, for all matrices
