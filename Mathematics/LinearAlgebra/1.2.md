# 1.2 Lengths and Angles from Dot products

The dot produce of 2 vectors can be denoted as the element wise product, and then a summation amongst all the products:

$\begin{bmatrix}a_1 \\ a_2\end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}x_1, x_2\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}a_1x_1 + a_2x_2\end{bmatrix} = C$

A dot product of $\vec{v}$ with itself, tells you the $L_2$ norm of the given vector.

Thereby, the dot product of $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{v}$, turns out to play a role in the pythagoras theorem as:

$\vec{v}^2 = \vec{v} \cdot \vec{v} = ||v||^2$

$\vec{w}^2 = \vec{w} \cdot \vec{w} = ||w||^2$

where then if $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ are the two sides to a triangle:

$||x||^2 = ||v||^2 + ||w||^2$, where $||x||$ is the magnitude of the hypotenuse. 

This is applicable to a triangle in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

Say we had a right triangle in $\mathbb{R}^3$ where the sides were of vectors:

$v = (1,2,0)$, $u = (0, 0, 3), w = (1, 2, 3)$.

The magnitude of $w$ would be determined as:

$||w||^2 = ||v||^2 + ||u||^2 = (1^2 + 2^2) + (3^2)$

**Unit Vector:**

A unit vector is a vector with a $||v|| = 1$.

Given a vector $\vec{u}$, we can find the unit vector by taking $\vec{u}$ and dividing it by $||u||$. 

Taking the magnitude of this result would then yield us $1$.

If we have $\vec{v} = (1, 2)$, we can find the unit vector as:

$||v|| = 1^2 + 2^2 = 5$

$\frac{v}{||v||} = unit(v) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}^2 + \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}^2} = 1$

The common unit vectors include $(1, 0)$ and $(cos\theta, sin\theta)$
### **Other**

**NULL SPACES**:

The null space of a matrix, say $A$, is defined as the set of vectors $x$ that yield the zero vector when taking the linear combination of:

$A\vec{x}$

Thereby $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$ must be true for any vector $\vec{x}$ to be the the $Nul(A)$

Note that this only applies to matrices, not vectors.

**ORTHOGONALITY**

Orthogonality denotes the trait that two vectors or matrices are perpendicular to each other.

A vector, $w$, is orthogonal to another vector, $v$, if the dot product of the two vectors equals the zero vector.

A matrix, $A$, is orthogonal to another matrix, $B$, if $A^TB = I$, where $I$ is the Identity Matrix.

If $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{u}$ are unit vectors, their angle $\theta$ can be given as $cos\theta = v \cdot u$

**Cosine Formula**

The dot products of unit vectors, $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{u}$ are equivalent to $cos\theta$, thereby we can find the angle of $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{u}$ by finding $\theta$.
