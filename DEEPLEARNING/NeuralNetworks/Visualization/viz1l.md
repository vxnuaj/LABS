## Notes

If the heatmaps weren't in a sense, 'smooth' or 'organized', or were more noisy, it would indicate that the model weights aren't converging properly to learn specific features of the dataset.

In essence, the printed heatmaps of the first layer of weights is learning more the features of the fashion dataset in a way that's generalizable to all clothing clases.

The second layer woudl then (per my intuition) learn more specific features. I will visualize this more once I train CIFAR-100
