### Recursion

When solving a recursive problem, 
ask yourself *what's the simplest possible input?*

This is called a **base case**, where we provide
an explicit answer in code.

Then the next step, is to use visualizations
to verify or denote how after *n* steps,
how each example relates to the prior.

This then (third step) allows you to relate
the harder cases to the simpler cases.

Mapping the relationships between the former and latter
will allow to find the general
patterns that can make up a single 
recursive function.
