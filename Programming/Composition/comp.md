### Problem: Dark Souls 3 Character Equipment Management

Create a `Character` class for managing a character's equipment in Dark Souls 3. Use composition to include classes for different types of equipment: `Weapon`, `ArmorSet`, and `RingSet`.

- **Weapon Class**: Manages a character's equipped weapon, including attributes like damage, type, and special effects.
  
- **ArmorSet Class**: Manages a set of armor pieces (head, chest, hands, legs) equipped by the character, with attributes for defense, weight, and resistance.

- **RingSet Class**: Manages a set of rings equipped by the character, each ring having unique effects on stats or abilities.

Your task is to design these classes using composition to allow a `Character` instance to manage and interact with their equipped weapons, armor sets, and rings effectively.
