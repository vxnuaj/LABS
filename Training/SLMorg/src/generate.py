Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lucy. She was very adventurous. She loved to explore the
world around her, especially when it was bright and sunny outside.
One day, while exploring the nearby park, Lucy came across a ladder leaning on a wall. She was curious
to see whatâ€™s on top, so she climbed the ladder, but when she reached the top, the ladder fell and she was
stuck.
